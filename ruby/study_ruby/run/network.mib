DESCRIPTION
        "Static prefix sub-type.  For a Static
        " prefix, this can be set to PrefixDelegation or Child, 
        "thereby creating an unconfigured prefix of the specified type that will 
        "be populated in preference to creating a new instance.  This allows the 
        "ACS to pre-create "prefix slots" with known path names that can be 
        "referenced from elsewhere in the data model before they have been 
        "populated.  Enumeration of:
        "Static
        " (Prefix is a "normal" Static
        " prefix)
        "  Inapplicable
        " (Prefix is not Static,
        " so this parameter does not apply)
        "  PrefixDelegation
        " (Prefix will be populated when a PrefixDelegation
        " prefix needs to be created)
        "  Child
        " (Prefix will be populated when a Child
        " prefix needs to be created. In this case, the ACS needs also to set ParentPrefix
        " and might want to set ChildPrefixBits
        " (if parent prefix is not set, or goes away, then the child prefix will 
        "become operationally disabled))
        "
        "This mechanism works as follows:
        "When this parameter is set to PrefixDelegation or Child,
        " the instance becomes a "prefix slot" of the specified type.
        "  Such an instance can be administratively enabled (Enable
        " = true) but will remain operationally disabled (Status
        " = Disabled)
        " until it has been populated.
        "  When a new prefix of of type T is needed, the CPE will look 
        "for a matching unpopulated instance, i.e. an instance with (Origin,StaticType,Prefix)
        " = (Static,T,"").
        "  If the CPE finds at least one such instance it will choose one and 
        "populate it.  If already administratively enabled it will immediately 
        "become operationally enabled.  If the CPE finds no such instances, it 
        "will create and populate a new instance with (Origin,StaticType)
        " = (T,T).  If the CPE finds more than one such instance, the algorithm 
        "via which it chooses which instance to populate is 
        "implementation-specific.
        "  When a prefix that was populated via this mechanism becomes 
        "invalid, the CPE will reset Prefix
        " to an empty string.  This does not affect the value of the Enable
        " parameter.

        "attempts to delete or modify a dynamic route entry.
        "For each incoming packet, the layer 3 forwarding decision is 
        "conceptually made as follows:

        " are considered, i.e. those that either do not specify a ForwardingPolicy,
        " or else specify a ForwardingPolicy
        " that matches that of the incoming packet.

        "address/mask are considered, and the matching entry with the longest 
        "prefix is applied to the packet (i.e. the entry with the most specific 
        "network). An unspecified destination address is a wild-card and always 
        "matches, but with a prefix length of zero.
        "
        "For enabled table entries, if Interface
        " is not a valid reference to an IPv4-capable interface (that is attached

        " set Status

        "Note: The IPv4Forwarding table includes a unique key parameter 
        "that is a strong reference. If a strongly referenced object is deleted, 
        "the CPE will set the referencing parameter to an empty string. However,

DESCRIPTION
        "Layer 3 IPv6 forwarding table.
        "In addition to statically configured routes, this table MUST include 
        "dynamic routes learned through layer 3 routing protocols, including 
        "RIPng, OSPF, DHCPv6, and RA.  The CPE MAY reject attempts to delete or 
        "modify a dynamic route entry.
        "For each incoming packet, the layer 3 forwarding decision is 
        "conceptually made as follows:
        "Only enabled table entries with a matching ForwardingPolicy
        " are considered, i.e. those that either do not specify a ForwardingPolicy,
        " or else specify a ForwardingPolicy
        " that matches that of the incoming packet. 
        "  Next, table entries that also have a matching destination 
        "prefix are considered, and the matching entry with the longest prefix 
        "length is applied to the packet (i.e. the entry with the most specific 
        "network). An unspecified destination address is a wild-card and always 
        "matches, but with a prefix length of zero.
        "
        "For enabled table entries, if Interface
        " is not a valid reference to an IPv6-capable interface (that is attached
        " to the IPv6 stack), then the table entry is inoperable and the CPE MUST
        " set Status
        " to Error_Misconfigured.
        "This object is based on inetCidrRouteTable from [RFC4292].
        "
        "At most one entry in this table (regardless of whether or not it is
