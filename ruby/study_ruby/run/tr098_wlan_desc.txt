AutoChannelEnable MUST automatically change to false 
whenever the channel is manually selected, i.e. whenever the Channel
 parameter is written.
Whenever AutoChannelEnable is true, the value of the Channel
 parameter MUST be the channel selected by the automatic channel 
selection procedure.

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.SSID
----------------------------------------------------------------
The current service set identifier in use by the
 connection.  The SSID is an identifier that is attached to packets sent

such capabilities.
An attempt to set this parameter to one of the REQUIRED (mandatory) 
values MAY be rejected if (and only if) the requested capability is not 
available on this WLANConfiguration instance but is available on another
 WLANConfiguration instance within this Internet Gateway Device. For 
example, only basic 802.11 might be supported by one virtual AP, and 
only WPA might be supported by another virtual AP.

 for the same instance of WLANConfiguration.  When either 
parameter is changed, the value of the other is changed as well.
If KeyPassphrase is written, all four WEP keys are immediately 
generated.  The ACS SHOULD NOT set the passphrase and also set the WEP 
keys directly (the result of doing this is undefined).
This MUST either be a valid key length divided by 8, in which case each 
byte contributes 8 bits to the key, or else MUST consist of Hex digits 
and be a valid key length divided by 4, in which case each byte 
contributes 4 bits to the key.

[Section 3.6.1/TR-069a4] and described in 
[Appendix II/TR-069a4], the following 
mandatory constraints MUST be enforced:
Its value MUST NOT be empty.
  Its value MUST start with a letter.
  If its instance object is created by the CPE, the initial 
value MUST start with a "cpe-" prefix.
  The CPE MUST NOT change the parameter value.

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.WEPKey.*.WEPKey
----------------------------------------------------------------
A WEP key expressed as a hexadecimal string. 
The WEP encryption level for a given key is inferred from the key 
length, e.g. 10 characters for 40-bit encryption, or 26 characters for 
104-bit encryption (keys do not all have to be of the same length, 
although they will be if the CPE uses InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.{i}.WLANConfiguration.{i}.KeyPassphrase
 to generate them).
If InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.{i}.WLANConfiguration.{i}.KeyPassphrase
 is written, all four WEP keys are immediately generated.  The ACS 
SHOULD NOT set the passphrase and also set the WEP keys directly (the 
result of doing this is undefined).

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.PreSharedKey.*.Alias
----------------------------------------------------------------
A non-volatile handle used to reference this 
instance. Alias provides a mechanism for an ACS to label this instance 
for future reference.
If the CPE supports the Alias-based Addressing feature as defined in 
[Section 3.6.1/TR-069a4] and described in 
[Appendix II/TR-069a4], the following 
mandatory constraints MUST be enforced:
Its value MUST NOT be empty.
  Its value MUST start with a letter.
  If its instance object is created by the CPE, the initial 
value MUST start with a "cpe-" prefix.
  The CPE MUST NOT change the parameter value.

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.PreSharedKey.*.PreSharedKey
----------------------------------------------------------------
A literal WPA PSK expressed as a hexadecimal 
string.
The first table entry contains the default PreSharedKey (InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.{i}.WLANConfiguration.{i}.PreSharedKey.1.PreSharedKey).
If KeyPassphrase
 is written, the PSK is immediately generated.  The ACS SHOULD NOT set 
the passphrase and also set the PSK directly (the result of doing this 
is undefined).

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.PreSharedKey.*.KeyPassphrase
----------------------------------------------------------------
A passphrase from which the PSK is to be 
generated.
The first table entry is the same as the parameter InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.{i}.WLANConfiguration.{i}.KeyPassphrase
 for the same instance of WLANConfiguration.  When either parameter is 
changed, the value of the other is changed as well.
If KeyPassphrase is written, the PSK is immediately generated.  
The ACS SHOULD NOT set the passphrase and also set the PSK directly (the
 result of doing this is undefined).
The key is generated as specified by WPA, which uses PBKDF2 from PKCS 
#5: Password-based Cryptography Specification Version 2.0 (RFC 2898 [RFC2898]).

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.PreSharedKey.*.AssociatedDeviceMACAddress
----------------------------------------------------------------
[MACAddress] 
  The MAC address associated with a preshared key, or an empty string if
 no MAC address is associated with the key.

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.APWMMParameter.*.Alias
----------------------------------------------------------------
A non-volatile handle used to reference this 
instance. Alias provides a mechanism for an ACS to label this instance 
for future reference.
If the CPE supports the Alias-based Addressing feature as defined in 
[Section 3.6.1/TR-069a4] and described in 
[Appendix II/TR-069a4], the following 
mandatory constraints MUST be enforced:
Its value MUST NOT be empty.
  Its value MUST start with a letter.
  If its instance object is created by the CPE, the initial 
value MUST start with a "cpe-" prefix.
  The CPE MUST NOT change the parameter value.

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.APWMMParameter.*.AIFSN
----------------------------------------------------------------
Arbitration Inter Frame Spacing (Number).  This 
is the number of time slots in the arbitration interframe space.

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.APWMMParameter.*.ECWMin
----------------------------------------------------------------
Exponent of Contention Window (Minimum). This 
encodes the Values of CWMin as an exponent: CWMin = 2^ECWMin - 1.
For example, if ECWMin is 8, then CWMin is 2^8 - 1, or 255,

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.APWMMParameter.*.ECWMax
----------------------------------------------------------------
Exponent of Contention Window (Maximum). This 
encodes the Values of CWMax as an exponent: CWMax = 2^ECWMax - 1.
For example, if ECWMax is 8, then CWMax is 2^8 - 1, or 255,

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.APWMMParameter.*.TXOP
----------------------------------------------------------------
Transmit Opportunity, in multiples of 32 
microseconds.

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.APWMMParameter.*.AckPolicy
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ack Policy, where false=Do Not 
Acknowledge and true=Acknowledge.

InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.*.WLANConfiguration.*.STAWMMParameter.*.Alias
----------------------------------------------------------------
A non-volatile handle used to reference this 
instance. Alias provides a mechanism for an ACS to label this instance 
for future reference.
If the CPE supports the Alias-based Addressing feature as defined in 
[Section 3.6.1/TR-069a4] and described in 
[Appendix II/TR-069a4], the following
